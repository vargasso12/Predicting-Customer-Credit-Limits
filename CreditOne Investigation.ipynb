    "# Credit One default on loans customers\n",
    "## 1. Introduction \n",
    "## 1.1 Project Background\n",
    "Over the past year or so Credit One has seen an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans they have secured from various partners, and Credit One, as their credit scoring service, could risk losing business if the problem is not solved right away. The bottom line is they need a much better way to understand how much credit to allow someone to use or, at the very least, if someone should be approved or not. They have enlisted the help of our Data Science team to design and implement a creative, empirically sound solution. It is very important that we all understand from the start that this is not a typical data analytics problem as we have been given full authority to solve this problem with whatever tools and methods we need. As such we've elected to use Python and a few different libraries to do the heavy lifting for us. We'll be using a few main libraries for the bulk of our work, but you should not limit yourselves to only using those - feel free to investigate other libraries if you think they will contribute to the best solution. \n",
    " \n",
    "Our first need is to define the problem within a data science framework and understand the differences between what we have been doing with data analytics and what we're going to be doing in this project with data science. Then, you'll use your local programming environment to do your work without needing to be in one space or another to have access to the tools you need, before finally starting the analysis and solving this problem. They will be providing the data that you'll be using for this task so you may use it to focus on understating the problem and getting your environment ready for the task soon. I'll be expecting a report on your experience and understanding of the problem in a few days."

    "This  research  aimed  at  the  case  of  customers  default  payments  in  Taiwan  and  compares the  predictive  accuracy  of  probability  of  default  among  six  data  mining  methods.  From the  perspective  of  risk  management,  the  result  of  predictive  accuracy  of  the  estimated probability  of  default  will  be  more  valuable  than  the  binary  result  of  classification  - credible  or  not  credible  clients.  Because  the  real  probability  of  default  is  unknown,  this study  presented  the  novel  Sorting  Smoothing  Method  to  estimate  the  real  probability  of default.  With  the  real  probability  of  default  as  the  response  variable  (Y),  and  the predictive  probability  of  default  as  the  independent  variable  (X),  the  simple  linear regression  result  (Y  =  A  +  BX)  shows  that  the  forecasting  model  produced  by  artificial neural  network  has  the  highest  coefficient  of  determination;  its  regression  intercept  (A)  is close  to  zero,  and  regression  coefficient  (B)  to  one.  Therefore,  among  the  six  data  mining techniques,  artificial  neural  network  is  the  only  one  that  can  accurately  estimate  the  real probability  of  default."
